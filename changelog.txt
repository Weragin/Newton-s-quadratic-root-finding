version 0.0.1 - Added the newton function, which could only solve quadratic equations at the time
version 0.0.2 - Tweaked the newton function for more type consistency.
              - Added class representation of quadratic polynomials.
              - Realised I could have just called the outside function newton()
                in the method solveWithNewton() of QuadraticPolynomial instead of
                copy/pasting the entirety of code, but was too lazy to change it back,
                since at that point, the two functions were different anyway. (bet im
                going to change it in the next version anyway)
